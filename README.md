# Noise Reduction and Thresholding in Python

This project demonstrates two core image processing techniques implemented from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Pillow.

## Noise Reduction

A Median and Mean filter is applied to remove noise from images. The filter replaces each pixel with the median of its neighboring pixels, effectively smoothing out sharp noise while preserving edges.

## Thresholding

Thresholding converts a grayscale or color image into a binary image. Each pixel is compared to a threshold value: if it's greater, it becomes white; if it's lower, it becomes black. This is useful for segmentation and highlighting object boundaries.
